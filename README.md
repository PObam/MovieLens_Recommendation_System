# Business Understanding
In the dynamic landscape of the entertainment industry, user engagement is paramount for platforms like ours. To effectively address user engagement, we must delve into the intricacies that shape it. By delving into users' historical interactions and preferences, we unearth valuable insights into their viewing habits, favored genres, and preferred content consumption times. Armed with this intelligence, 
Our goal is to create a cutting-edge movie recommendation system that significantly enhances user engagement by delivering personalized movie suggestions. We aim to address the challenge of assisting users in discovering movies that align closely with their preferences and maximizing their satisfaction.

# Problem Statement
To achieve this objective, we seek to build an advanced recommendation system that provides users with top 5 movie recommendations based on their historical movie ratings and interactions. This personalized recommendation approach utilizes collaborative filtering as its primary mechanism, leveraging user behavior patterns to make accurate predictions.

# Data
The MovieLens dataset from the University of Minnesota serves as the foundation for this recommendation system. The dataset consists of three main components: movies, ratings, and links. These components provide comprehensive information about user interactions and preferences within the movie platform.
Method
The models used during the project are:
    Collaborative Filtering
    Singular Value Decomposition
    K-nearest neighbor
